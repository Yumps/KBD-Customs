# KBD Customs
A React app to help provide easier resources and a keyboard builder to help manage your browser tabs.

## Why create this?
A lot of info for building custom keyboards is scattered, so info can be tough to come by or very vague.
I have created an app to hopefully help clear up some information and make it easier to find the answers you need; as well as provide a builder, so that the user could create a keyboard using one tab rather than multiple on your browser.

## Clone the repo
Clone the repo down in one terminal and then start the server
```
git clone git@github.com:Yumps/KBD-Customs.git
cd KBD-Customs
npm install
npm start
```
You will also need another terminal opened for the database
 ```
 cd KBD-Customs/api
json-server -p 5002 database.json
```
